  ~ðŸ§ ~ String Drills ~ðŸ§ ~

  Strings are characters wrapped in quotes.

  These can be 'single', "double", and `backtick.`

  The `backticks` are called template literals, and 
  allow us to do cool stuff like this ...*/
  const orderNumber = 598;
  const packageMessage = `Order #${orderNumber} is ready to ship!`;/*

  Note the $dollar sign$ and {braces} that surround the variable.

  The instructions may be a bit sparse, do your best to write
  full sentences pls ðŸ™ƒ

*/

// Create a variable with the name "name"
// Assign it any relatively human name

// Create a number variable

// Create a template literal enthusiastically greeting the above name

// Ask the above name what their favorite kind of dessert is

// Write a happy birthday message to the name above

// Ask the above name if they are that number years old

// Create 3 variables, each of them a food.
// Ask the name above if they like any of those foods

// Using the variables below, calculate the total bill
// and draft a text to your friends.
  const myTotal = 14.99;
  const yourTotal = 589.23;
  

// Without creating any variables, create a template
// literal that prints out as:
//    ## 
//    ##  Your total is $20.20, how will you be paying?
//    ##
// Your answer must include the addition operator +
